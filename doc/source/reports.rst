Customizing
===========

The ``katprep_report`` utility uses **Pandoc** and special templates in order to automate creating patch reports per host. Default templates are part of every katprep installation - it is also possible to alter these templates to match your company needs (*e.g. corporate identity*).

**TODO:** Add examples, explain template variables
